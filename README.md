# Hi there! 大家好！👋

I'm  _Phillip Schackier_. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science from the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences.
I'm a software developer with over 10 years of experience predominantly programming in C and C++. I'm enthusiastic about modern C++ and love to share my
knowledge.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

- a comprehensive video course on modern C++ teaching good practices from the very beginning
- building my business as a programming tutor

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

- exciting new C++20 features such as modules, ranges, concepts, and coroutines
- Mandarin Chinese. 我学中文学了两年了，但是我只能说一点儿，哈哈。我是德国人，我觉得中文很难，但是我非常感兴趣中国的文化和中国的历史。
